## _Let's take a closer look at some of the commands we came across in lv22!_

> **_md5sum_**

```bash
md5sum test.txt
# this command calculates and displays the MD5 hash value of the file "test.txt".
```

The MD5 hash value is a 32-character hexadecimal (or base-16) representation of a 128-bit hash key that is generated by applying the MD5 algorithm to the contents of the file.

The MD5 hash value can be used to evaluate the integrity of a file by checking its checksum. If the contents of the file change in any way, even by a single character, the MD5 hash value will change, indicating that the file is no longer the same as the original. Therefore, by comparing the MD5 hash value of a file before and after transmission or storage, you can verify that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted.

> **_cut_**

```bash
cat test.txt | cut -d ' ' -f 1

# 'd' for 'delimiter'

# '-f 1' specifies the field that we want to extract. In this case, it's the first field of text in each line.
```
