# make the terminal window really small, then run `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost` - this should jam bandit26's startup shell script because the `more` command wouldn't be able to page its content properly.

# this allows us to open the startup shell in Vi editor, where we can temper with the script
