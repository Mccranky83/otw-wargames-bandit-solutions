The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

# '-sV' enables version detection, allowing nmap to attempt to determine the version of any services running on the open ports.

# '-T4' sets the timing template of the scan to "aggressive," indicating that the scan should be performed more quickly but with higher resource utilization.
